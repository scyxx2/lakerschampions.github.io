Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Andrew. I am from Ningbo, China. I am studying at the University of Nottingham. My major is computer science, artificial intelligence, and interested in data mining, machine learning, neural network and other fields of artificial intelligence. This is my first time to do my own personal blog, and I am very grateful for the materials provided by <em>h010000110</em> (reference), which has helped me a lot.
